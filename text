Subject: Follow-up on Salary Increment Discussion

Dear [Chapter Lead/Vice President's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to kindly remind you about our previous discussion regarding my salary increment. During our last conversation, you mentioned that we could revisit the topic starting from December onward.

As there was no increment last year, I would appreciate it if we could reconsider the matter at your earliest convenience. Please let me know if you need any additional information from my side.

Thank you very much for your time and support.

Best regards,
Muhammad Ali Hassan
