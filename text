Subject: Clarification Needed on Third-Party WebView Integration Scenarios

Hi Suhas,

I hope you are doing well. As part of the ongoing integration of a third-party service through a WebView in Skiply, I’ve outlined a few user story scenarios where I require your architectural guidance. Below are the key details and clarifications needed for User Story #13304:

1. Payment Integration
Scenario:
Given I complete the required process through the third-party WebView, when I proceed to payment, then I should be redirected to Skiply’s checkout and payment gateway path.

Clarification Needed:

What is the most efficient way to implement the redirection to Skiply’s payment gateway?
2. Confirmation and Callback
Scenario:
Given I complete the required process and payment successfully, when the transaction is finalized, then a confirmation message should be displayed in Skiply as a pop-up, and a receipt should be available in Skiply.

Clarification Needed:

Should Skiply provide a webhook or callback endpoint for the third-party service to notify Skiply of payment completion?
3. Error Handling
Scenario:
Given an error occurs while using the third-party WebView (e.g., timeout, technical issue), when the error is encountered, then an appropriate error message should be displayed, and I should have an option to retry.

Clarification Needed:

What mechanisms should be in place to capture errors within the WebView (e.g., event listeners or API responses)?
4. Exit Option
Scenario:
Given I am in the third-party WebView, when I decide to return to the main Skiply dashboard, then I should have a visible "Back to Dashboard" or "Exit" button that closes the WebView and navigates me back to Skiply without losing my session.

Clarification Needed:

How can session persistence be maintained in Skiply during and after WebView closure (e.g., via cookies or local storage)?
These scenarios are part of User Story #13304. I look forward to your insights on these points to proceed effectively.
