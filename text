4. Payment Integration

Given I complete the visa application through the Atlys iframe,
When I proceed to payment,
Then I should be redirected to Skiplyâ€™s checkout and payment gateway path.
5. Confirmation and Callback

Given I complete my visa application and payment successfully,
When the transaction is finalized,
Then a confirmation message should be displayed in Skiply as the pop-up and a receipt should be available in Skiply.
6. Error Handling

Given an error occurs while using the Atlys Visa Services iframe (e.g., timeout, technical issue),
When the error is encountered,
Then an appropriate error message should be displayed, and I should have an option to retry.
7. Exit Option

Given I am in the Atlys Visa Services iframe,
When I decide to return to the main Skiply dashboard,
Then I should have a visible "Back to Dashboard" or "Exit" button that closes the iframe and navigates me back to Skiply without losing my session.
