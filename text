Subject: Clarification Needed on Solutions for Third-Party WebView Integration with Skiply

Hi Suhas,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of the ongoing integration of a third-party service through a WebView in Skiply, I have outlined some key areas where I require your architectural guidance and solutions. Below are the details of each requirement and the specific clarifications needed:

1. Payment Integration
Scenario:
Given I complete the required process through the third-party WebView, when I proceed to payment, then I should be redirected to Skiply’s checkout and payment gateway path.

Clarification Needed:

What is the most efficient way to implement the redirection to Skiply’s payment gateway?
Should the third-party WebView generate a payment token/session identifier to pass to Skiply for secure processing?
Can Skiply’s payment gateway handle incoming requests with session tokens or identifiers for validation?
How should this process ensure compliance with payment security standards such as PCI-DSS?
2. Confirmation and Callback
Scenario:
Given I complete the required process and payment successfully, when the transaction is finalized, then a confirmation message should be displayed in Skiply as a pop-up, and a receipt should be available in Skiply.

Clarification Needed:

Should Skiply provide a webhook or callback endpoint for the third-party service to notify Skiply of payment completion?
What format should be used for sending receipt details back to Skiply?
How can Skiply dynamically trigger a pop-up to display the confirmation message and ensure the receipt is linked to the user’s session?
3. Error Handling
Scenario:
Given an error occurs while using the third-party WebView (e.g., timeout, technical issue), when the error is encountered, then an appropriate error message should be displayed, and I should have an option to retry.

Clarification Needed:

What mechanisms should be in place to capture errors within the WebView (e.g., event listeners or API responses)?
Should we categorize errors (e.g., network, validation, server-side) and display customized messages for each?
What retry mechanism would you suggest for such errors? For example, should retries be manual via a button or automated with exponential backoff?
4. Exit Option
Scenario:
Given I am in the third-party WebView, when I decide to return to the main Skiply dashboard, then I should have a visible "Back to Dashboard" or "Exit" button that closes the WebView and navigates me back to Skiply without losing my session.

Clarification Needed:

Should the “Exit” button use window.postMessage to communicate with the Skiply parent window?
How can session persistence be maintained in Skiply during and after WebView closure (e.g., via cookies or local storage)?
Would you recommend adding additional safeguards to ensure user data remains intact when navigating back to the dashboard?
Your expertise in architecture and system design would be invaluable in providing clear solutions to these queries. Please share your recommendations at your earliest convenience so we can proceed with development confidently.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
